# Prints string

# Printing a string, followed by a calculation on the same line
print "Hens", 25.0 + 30.0 / 6.0

# Printing another string
print "I will now count the eggs:"

# Counting all the eggs. Way more operations than necessary
print 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0

# Printing a string asking if math is true
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

# Actually doing the math from the above string
print 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0

# Breaking apart the above comparison into the two sides
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3.0 + 2.0

# Printing a string
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

# Printing another string
print "How about some more."

# Directly doing different comparisons of the above math
print "Is it greater?", 5.0 > -2.0
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5.0 >= -2.0
print "Is it less or equal?", 5.0 <= -2.0
